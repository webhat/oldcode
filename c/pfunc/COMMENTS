COMMENT:

	I finally wrote this because I couldn't find a
pkill or pgrep for Linux. (Sure, I can now!)
Anyway you know the rules, read the COPYING file
and have fun using it.

	For the interested this was tested, build and compiled on:

TurboLinux release 1.0 (Kyoto)
Mandrake release 6.1 (Helios)
Mandrake release 7.0 (Air)

Compiled but no prize:
SunOS 5.7 Generic October 1998
