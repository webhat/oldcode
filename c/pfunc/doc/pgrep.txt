DESCRIPTION

     The pgrep  utility examines the active processes on the sys-
     tem  and  reports  the  process  IDs  of the processes whose
     attributes match the criteria specified on the command line.
     Each  process  ID  is  printed  as  a  decimal  value and is
     separated from the next ID  by  a  delimiter  string,  which
     defaults  to  a newline. For each attribute option, the user
     can specify a set of possible values separated by commas  on
     the command line. For example,

     pgrep  -G other,daemon

     matches processes whose real group ID is other OR daemon. If
     multiple  criteria  options  are  specified,  pgrep  matches
     processes whose attributes match the logical AND of the cri-
     teria options. For example,

     pgrep  -G other,daemon -U root,daemon

     matches processes whose attributes are:

               (real group ID is other OR daemon) AND

               (real user ID is root OR daemon)

     pkill functions identically to  pgrep  ,  except  that  each
     matching  process  is  signaled  as if by kill(1) instead of
     having its process ID printed. A signal name or  number  may
     be specified as the first command line option to pkill.


OPTIONS

     The following options are supported:

     -d delim  Specifies  the  output  delimiter  string  to   be
               printed between each matching process ID. If no -d
               option is specified,  the  default  is  a  newline
               character. The -d option is only valid when speci-
               fied as an option to pgrep .

     -f        The regular expression pattern should  be  matched
               against the full process argument string (obtained
               from the pr_psargs field of the /proc/nnnnn/psinfo
               file).  If  no -f option is specified, the expres-
               sion is matched only against the name of the  exe-
               cutable  file (obtained from the pr_fname field of
               the /proc/nnnnn/psinfo file).

     -g pgrplist
               Matches only processes whose process group  ID  is
               in  the  given list. If group 0 is included in the
               list, this is interpreted as the process group  ID
               of the pgrep  or pkill  process.

     -G gidlist
               Matches only processes whose real group ID  is  in
               the  given list. Each group ID may be specified as
               either a group name or a numerical group ID.

     -l        Long output format. Print the process  name  along
               with  the process ID of each matching process. The
               process name is obtained  from  the  pr_psargs  or
               pr_fname field, depending on whether the -f option
               was specified (see above). The -l option  is  only
               valid when specified as an option to pgrep .

     -n        Matches only the newest  (most  recently  created)
               process  which  meets all other specified matching
               criteria.

     -P ppidlist
               Matches only processes whose parent process ID  is
               in the given list.

     -s sidlist
               Matches only processes whose process session ID is
               in  in  the given list. If ID 0 is included in the
               list, this is interpreted as the session ID of the
               pgrep  or pkill  process.

     -t termlist
               Matches only processes which are associated with a
               terminal  in  the  given  list.  Each  terminal is
               specified as the suffix following "/dev/"  of  the
               terminal's  device path name in /dev. For example,
               term/a or pts/0.

     -u euidlist
               Matches only processes whose effective user ID  is
               in  the  given list. Each user ID may be specified
               as either a login name or a numerical user ID.

     -U uidlist
               Matches only processes whose real user  ID  is  in
               the  given  list. Each user ID may be specified as
               either a login name or a numerical user ID.

     -v        Reverses the sense of the  matching.  Matches  all
               processes  except  those  which meet the specified
               matching criteria.

     -x        Considers only processes whose argument string  or
               executable file name exactly matches the specified
               pattern to  be  matching  processes.  The  pattern
               match  is  considered to be exact when all charac-
               ters in the process argument string or  executable
               file name match the pattern.

     -signal   Specifies the signal to send to each matched  pro-
               cess.  If  no signal is specified, SIGTERM is sent
               by default. The value of signal can be one of  the
               symbolic  names  defined  in signal(5) without the
               SIG prefix, or the corresponding signal number  as
               a  decimal value. The -signal option is only valid
               when specified as the first option to pkill.


OPERANDS

     The following operand is supported:

     pattern   Specifies an  Extended  Regular  Expression  (ERE)
               pattern  to  match  against  either the executable
               file name or full  process  argument  string.  See
               regex(5)  for  a  complete  description of the ERE
               syntax.


EXAMPLES

     Example 1: Obtaining a process ID

     Obtain the process ID of sendmail :

     example% pgrep -x -u root sendmail
     283

     Example 2: Terminating a process

     Terminate the most recently created xterm:

     example% pkill -n xterm


EXIT STATUS

     The following exit values are returned:

     0         One or more processes were matched.

     1         No processes were matched.

     2         Invalid command line options were specified.

     3         A fatal error occurred.

NOTES

     Both utilities match the ERE pattern argument against either
     the  pr_fname  or pr_psargs fields of the /proc/nnnnn/psinfo
     files. The lengths of these strings are limited according to
     definitions  in  <sys/procfs.h>.  Patterns  which  can match
     strings longer than the current limits may fail to match the
     intended set of processes.

     If the pattern argument contains ERE  meta-characters  which
     are  also  shell  meta-characters,  it  may  be necessary to
     enclose the pattern with appropriate shell quotes.

     Defunct processes are  never  matched  by  either  pgrep  or
     pkill.

     The current pgrep  or  pkill  process  will  never  consider
     itself a potential match.
