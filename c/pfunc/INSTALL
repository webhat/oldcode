INSTALL:

	You can install this in many ways, my advise is
to run:

	./configure
	make

Then as root:

	make install

	You can also run make local to add the program
in your $HOME/bin directory.

	If you have any problems with the installation,
or can port this to a different platform, one I
don't support, please send me your diffs or code
so I can add them to the distro.

	Please send clear bug reports.
