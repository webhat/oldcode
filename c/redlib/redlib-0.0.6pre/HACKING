HACKING

	For a full compile of this project there are actually a number
of obscure and less obscure libraries and headers which should
be install.


ENCRYPT

	The most complex, inclusion wise, is the encryption. This can
be compiled with many different actual encryption libraries, some
adding more or less the same functionality. As the library's main
function is to supply a constant api for all the supported
libraries it means that some functions are taken from one or the
other.
	As different libraries include different functions it may be
that one includes a cryptography which the other does not.
libmix [1] includes only the former aes candidates, of which
rijndael sadly was the winner. And libmcrypt [2], also a good
library, includes all these and more.
	gnomepgp mod [3]


PTRACE

	One of the simpler implementations, it defines a numer of
common calls to ptrace. With the library libdisasm, which is part
of `bastard' [4], it also includes a number of functions to
decode machine code to a more readable form, handy checking if
gcc's dead code elimination has been working it's wonders. dc:
